            <p>Right now, I'm mostly working on Bloc's data warehouse. Our data warehouse is our main source of information about our students and leads. I've been working on making our ETL processes run faster, as well as making sure the data is accurate as possible.</p>

              <p>I'm located in Nashville, TN (Go Preds!). </p>


            <h4>How did you end up working remotely?</h4> 

            <p>I was working in San Francisco for a fashion start up when my ex-wife asked if we could move back to Nashville. I had lived in Nashville for about 8 years before moving to San Francisco in 2012. I really loved Nashville, and it had just started experiencing quite a bit of growth so there was a fair amount of new things to try and experience there. I said yes, and we started figuring out how to break this to our employers. I really loved my team, and my company, so I wanted to try to stay on board if possible.</p>

            <p>I asked my CEO if it was a possibility, she said she would think about it. I had recently been promoted to Tech Lead, and we were both afraid that it would be difficult to move into that role remotely. It ended up working out pretty well. I've been remote ever since.</p>

         
           
            
            <h4>What are the largest challenges you've encountered?</h4> 
            <p>I think the largest challenge for me is knowing when to stop working. It's easier working in an office to not take things home with you. I'm already at home, so the line between work life and home life is a little blurred. I've set clear boundaries for my colleagues, and they respect them, but I find that I have a hard time respecting those boundaries myself. I enjoy what I do, and I have caught myself working well past dinner time just because what I was working on was fun. </p>
            
             <blockquote class="blockquote"><em>I think the largest challenge for me is knowing when to stop working.</em></blockquote>

            <h4>Where is the most interesting place you’ve ever worked from?</h4> 
            <p>Oh man, I'm pretty boring. I typically work a coffee shop in whatever city I'm in, and I don't travel a ton, so nowhere cool really :( </p>
            
            <h4>What time zone do you keep?</h4> 
            
            <p>I keep Central time zone. This works out really well for me because it gives me about 3-4 hours of time just to myself in the morning, and then 3-4 hours of time with the team. We are all very respectful of each others time outside of each others work hours, so nothing tends to disrupt my work/life balance.
            </p>
            <p>
            At my previous job, it was completely different. I basically had to keep Pacific Time which meant doing everything 2 hours later. That was pretty difficult.  
            </p>
           

            <h4>What gear do you use on a day to day basis? Is there anything that makes your job easier?</h4> 
             
            <p>13" Macbook Pro,  Thunderbolt Display, an Apple Keyboard and Mouse. </p>
  
           
            <h4>Do you have any advice for anyone thinking about going remote or just starting out?</h4>

            <p>Dress up. This is pretty common advice, but dressing like you're working will helps remind you that you should be working while at home. If you are going to be working from a home office, get a part-time desk at a co-working space, or visit a coffee shop a few times a week (if you can be productive there). </p>
            
            <p>It's also important to lean towards over-communicating.</p>
            
            <h4>What has been the most rewarding aspect of working remotely?</h4>
            <p>I love cooking. I love that I don't have to commute home and I can just close my laptop, and start cooking an awesome meal to close out the end of my day. </p>

            <h4>How does your current cost of living compare with other places you’ve lived?</h4>
           
              <p>I'd say it's slightly cheaper than Austin.</p>

              <h4>How much does a cup of coffee cost?</h4>
              <p> A cup of drip coffee from a nice coffee shop in Nashville costs about $2.50.</p>

            <h4>What’s next for you? (Location, remote vs office, etc.)</h4> 
            <p>I don't see myself moving away from Nashville, but I'd really like to work from a beach soon :P </p>
