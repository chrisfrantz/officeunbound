                <h4 >What are you working on and where are you located? </h4>
                <p>I work for a few companies running their social media for part of my week and then am a commercial photographer and marketing consultant in Denver, Colorado the rest of the time. I dedicate no more than 30 hours a week to helping run other companies social media (which I currently have 1, 5-hour slot open).</p>

            <h4>How did you end up working remotely?</h4> 
            <p> I started after getting sick in India/Nepal and missing out on going to the basecamp of Everest. I had spent 10 days in India before going on a 2 week trek in Nepal. On day 5 I got a bacterial infection that left me immobile and without food for 5 days making me unable to do the trek. The recovery from getting that sick was going to be at least a month and I knew I wanted to start getting into marketing. So I continued learning stuff while I could and then found a couple small freelance gigs that would pay the bills as I built things up. </p>


            <h4>Where is the most interesting place you’ve ever worked from?</h4> 
           <p>I can’t say I’ve worked anywhere all that interesting yet. Mostly coffee shops around the Denver area. I usually try and get all my clients set up when I go on vacation so that I’m not taking work with me. However, I will be going to LA this August and plan on working while I’m there.</p>
            

            <h4>What time zone do you keep?</h4> 
            <p>So far everyone I work with is in the same time zone as me so It’s not too much of an issue. (Mountain Time) </p>
            

            <h4>What are the largest challenges you've encountered?</h4> 
            <p>Oh man, there’s probably two. Finding the work and not going insane being at home by yourself all the time. </p>

               <h4>What gear do you use on a day to day basis?</h4> 
            <p>There’s a lot. I have a desktop computer and a laptop. I usually stay at home in the mornings getting work done on my desktop and then in the afternoon will take my laptop to my patio or a coffee shop for a change of scenery. I have a handful of external hard drives  that I use along with all my photography gear for photoshoots. I edit all photos on my desktop because it’s way bigger, using Lightroom and Photoshop. I love Buffer for organizing social postings (free or upgraded versions). I also have my day planner which keeps me organized especially with running my own social and content plus the social and content of my clients.</p>

            <h4>Do you ever run into any difficulties explaining your choice to work remotely to others? What’s the general reaction you receive?</h4> 
            <p>I make a joke with my sister that I’m Chandler from Friends, no one knows what I do. I think the people closest to me have the hardest time understanding it. They thing my entire day is free or I can easily rearrange my schedule just because I’m my own boss. The reality is I keep a strict schedule because I know what will be the most productive (I’m best in the morning so I plow through as much as I can then.) There’s definitely moments where it’s a struggle but I haven’t been happier so It’s a very small price to pay.</p>

            <h4>Do you have any advice for anyone thinking about going remote or just starting out?</h4>
            <p>Have a plan. Going freelance means having clients that will leave at the drop of a hat and your bills count on that account. I try and have a least 1 client I’m pretty sure will stick around for awhile, but there’s no guarantee. If you’re hired by a company and are working from home I suggest getting out of the house. I try and go out for at least 30 minutes a day to see real humans. Whether that’s running errands or working at a coffee shop, just get out of the house. </p>

            <h4>What has been the most rewarding aspect of working remotely?</h4> 
            <p>My grandmother who is 89 lives 20 minutes away and I try and get out and see her at least once a week. It’s actually been a great way to keep up with everyone in the family. My mom and I get lunch for “Taco Tuesdays” at On The Border most Tuesdays and sometimes my brother and his wife will join too.  </p>

             <h4>How does your current cost of living compare with other places you’ve lived?</h4> 
             <p>My parents own my condo and therefor keep rent low. If I was living anywhere else in Denver I’m not sure I could be doing this. I’m still building up my business and slowly getting more marketing consultations and photo shoots but it’s great having the extra help of low rent. </p>


            <h4>What’s next for you? (Location, remote vs office, etc.)</h4> 
            <p>Ideally with working from home I’m hoping I can get some more traveling in. I’ve got lots of family trips planned this year and possibly a work trip with my boyfriend this summer. Otherwise it’s all about building the business and getting out there. </p>
