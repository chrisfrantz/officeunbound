            <p>I'm the Head of Curriculum at Codecademy. We teach millions of people the skills they need to find coding and design jobs. Codecademy is located in NYC, but I live and work remotely in Maryland. I travel to NYC frequently as well.</p>


            <h4>How did you end up working remotely?</h4> 

            <p>I started working remotely 5 years ago at Bloc, an online coding bootcamp. They were a new startup (3 founders) when I joined. I wasn't willing to move to San Francisco, so we decided to see how remote work suited us. As the company grew, I built the curriculum and mentor teams and they consisted primarily of remote employees and contractors.</p>

                 </div> 
                  <h4>What are the largest challenges you've encountered?</h4> 
            <p>I've found that some people think remote work is bullshit and that if you work remotely you're probably not doing much. Some people need to see you in the office to believe you're working hard. There's not much you can say to convince people with this mindset, you can only prove yourself through your work. </p>
            
             <blockquote class="blockquote"><em>Some people need to see you in the office to believe you're working hard. There's not much you can say to convince people with this mindset, you can only prove yourself through your work.</em></blockquote>

            <h4>Where is the most interesting place you’ve ever worked from?</h4> 
            <p>There's no particular place that stands out.I don't travel to many exotic locations. I love the town I live in and love taking small trips in my region. I value the fact that work is not a constraint for me living and travelling where I want. </p>
            
            <h4>What time zone do you keep?</h4> 
            
            <p>Eastern time. I don't let overlapping schedules disrupt me. When I worked remotely at Bloc, they were on Pacific time. I would block off 5PM - 8PM Eastern as "personal time" so they wouldn't schedule meetings during that time. It worked fine and if something was urgent I'd be happy to get back online later at night.
            </p>

            <h4>What gear do you use on a day to day basis? Is there anything that makes your job easier?</h4> 
             
            <p>Pretty standard stuff. Slack, Skype, Hangouts, etc. I don't use a special mic or headphones, standard Apple issue work fine for me. I like to keep things simple.</p>

               </div>   
           
            <h4>Do you have any advice for anyone thinking about going remote or just starting out?</h4>

            <p>I'm a big advocate for remote work, but the company you work for has to be comfortable with it. If it's not a remote-friendly company you may be viewed as an outsider. I think this is a mindset that's possible to change, but it'll be an uphill battle. If you find a remote friendly company, make the most of it. Find the ideal town you want to live. If you want to raise a family, find a great school system. You can build the lifestyle you want and have the time to enjoy it by cutting out things like commutes. Also, don't settle for less money because you live in a "lower cost of living" area. Ask for the salary you think you deserve regardless of zip code.</p>
            <h4>Do you ever run into any difficulties explaining your choice to work remotely to others? </h4>
            <p>Nope.</p>
            
            <h4>What has been the most rewarding aspect of working remotely?</h4>
            <p>The ability to be a more involved friend and family member to those who I'm closest with.</p>

            <h4>How does your current cost of living compare with other places you’ve lived?</h4>
           
              <p>It's in the moderate range. Suburban DC isn't cheap, but it's not San Francisco either.</p>

            <h4>What’s next for you? (Location, remote vs office, etc.)</h4> 
            <p>I'm happy where I'm at. Codecademy is a great company and I love my town. I don't mind my short trips to NYC either. I hope what's "next" is more of the same. It'd be nice if Elon Musk built a hyperloop from Baltimore to NYC, but overall I'm cool :) </p>
